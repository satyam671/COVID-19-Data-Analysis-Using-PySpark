![1_y2SsUh89eQShLdIipSO4eg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a8b8416-ba41-4d6a-a588-129f4f6026cd)

## Decoding the Pandemic: A Big Data Approach

This project leverages the power of PySpark to analyze global COVID-19 data, providing insights into the pandemic's progression and impact across different countries and continents.

## ü¶† About the Project

In this data engineering endeavor, we dive deep into the SARS-CoV-2 dataset curated by Our World in Data (OWiD). While the dataset size doesn't necessarily warrant big data tools, this project serves as an educational gateway into the world of distributed computing with PySpark.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- PySpark: Apache Spark's Python API for distributed data processing
- SQL: For query-based data manipulation
- Python: For additional data handling and visualization

## üîç Project Structure: What We Explore -

1. **Data Loading & Overview**: Initial steps in big data processing
2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handling missing values in large datasets
   - Outlier detection at scale
   - Efficient duplicate entry management
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Mortality trends across countries
   - Case rates per million population
   - Hospital and ICU admission patterns
   - Geographic visualizations of case distribution
   - Excess mortality correlations
   - Continent-level reproduction rates
   - Feature correlation analysis
   - Health condition impacts on COVID-19 spread
   - K-means clustering for country grouping

## üéØ Project Goals

- Demonstrate proficiency in PySpark for big data analysis
- Showcase data engineering skills in cleaning and preprocessing large datasets
- Provide valuable insights into the global COVID-19 situation
- Explore the potential of distributed computing in epidemiological research
